SkiDracek is a compact, easy-to-navigate presentation website for a local ski lift and slope area, designed to provide all key visitor information in one place — from lift operation times and weather updates to pricing and photos.

This project focuses on creating a simple, fast, and visually appealing static website that conveys professionalism, reliability, and the friendly, family-oriented atmosphere of SkiDráček.

Tagline: “Malý vlek, velká zábava.”
